# Developer Guidelines

This document outlines the coding standards, directory structures, and best practices for developing the **Order Management System (OMS)** frontend.

## Developer Considerations

### Suggested Folder Structure and Naming Conventions:

```plaintext
.vscode/            # VSCode specific settings
node_modules/       # Node.js modules (auto-generated)

public/             # Static public assets
  |- index.html     # HTML entry point
  |- favicon.ico    # Site favicon, other static files

src/                # Main source folder
  |- app/           # Application-wide configurations
      |- assets/    # Static images, fonts, or other assets used in the app
  |- components/    # Reusable UI components (PascalCase)
      |- Button.tsx    # Example component
      |- Form.tsx      # Example component
  |- context/       # Context providers (React Context API)
      |- AuthContext.tsx  # Example context file for authentication
      |- ThemeContext.tsx # Context for managing theme (dark/light mode)
  |- features/      # Feature-based modules (separation by feature)
      |- orders/        # Example feature for orders
          |- OrderList.tsx   # List view for orders
          |- OrderForm.tsx   # Form for creating/updating orders
  |- hooks/         # Custom React hooks (camelCase)
      |- useAuth.ts  # Example: Custom hook for authentication
      |- useTheme.ts # Custom hook for theme toggling
  |- page/          # Pages that represent routes
      |- HomePage.tsx   # Example homepage route
      |- LoginPage.tsx  # Login page
  |- router/        # App routing setup
      |- index.tsx  # Main router setup file
  |- ui/            # Shared UI components like buttons, modals, etc.
      |- Modal.tsx  # Example modal component
      |- Button.tsx # Shared button UI
  |- utils/         # Utility/helper functions (camelCase)
      |- apiClient.ts  # Axios or fetch setup for API calls
      |- formatDate.ts # Example utility for formatting dates
  |- App.tsx        # Main App component
  |- main.tsx       # Application entry point
  |- index.css      # Global CSS styles (can be divided into SCSS or modules)

.gitignore          # Files to ignore in version control
eslint.config.js    # Linting configuration
package.json        # Dependencies and scripts
tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
vite.config.ts      # Vite build tool configuration
README.md           # Project documentation
```

### Naming Conventions:

- **Directory Names**: Use **kebab-case** for folder names (all lowercase, words separated by hyphens). This is consistent, readable, and prevents case-sensitivity issues.
  - Example: `components`, `context`, `features`, `hooks`, `router`, `utils`

- **Component Names**: Use **PascalCase** for React component names and folder names that represent specific components. This makes components easily distinguishable.
  - Example: `Button.tsx`, `OrderForm.tsx`

- **Hooks**: Custom hooks should follow the **camelCase** convention and always start with `use`.
  - Example: `useAuth.ts`, `useTheme.ts`

- **Utilities**: Utility files follow **camelCase** and typically export functions used across the app.
  - Example: `formatDate.ts`, `apiClient.ts`

- **Context**: Context providers are organized in the `context/` folder. Use **PascalCase** for context files and context provider components.
  - Example: `AuthContext.tsx`, `ThemeContext.tsx`

- **Pages**: Route pages are defined in the `page/` folder with **PascalCase**.
  - Example: `HomePage.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`

### Key Structural Decisions:

- **App Structure**: Separate the app into feature-based modules under `features/`. This keeps the app scalable, especially as more features are added.
  - Example: `features/orders/` contains everything related to orders: list views, forms, services, etc.

- **UI Components**: Keep reusable UI components (like buttons, modals) in a dedicated `ui/` folder. These can be used across the app in various features.
  
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks, specific to state or side effects, are centralized in the `hooks/` folder, encouraging reuse and cleaner components.

- **Utils**: Utility functions (for formatting, API handling, etc.) should live in the `utils/` folder to maintain separation of concerns and avoid repetition.

- **Context Management**: Organize all React Context logic in `context/`. This makes it easier to manage global state, like theme or authentication, and use it across the app.

- **Router**: Place all routing logic and configurations in `router/`, ensuring clean separation of concerns. This setup is ideal for organizing routes and nested routing.

By following this structure, The app will remain clean, scalable, and maintainable as it grows.
